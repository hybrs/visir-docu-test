    <h1>Welcome to VISIR-2 documentation</h1>
    <p>VISIR-2 is a numerical model designed for calculating optimal ship tracks. 
        It serves the purpose of identifying the most efficient routes in relation to environmental factors such as the sea state, the sea currents, or the winds. 
        The optimization objective can be voyage length, duration, or overall CO2 emissions. 
        The numerical scheme relies on a dynamic graph-search method. Ship performance modelling is provided through a Look-Up Table (LUT).

        VISIR (pronounced [vi'zi:r]) is an acronym and stands for "discoVerIng Safe and effIcient Routes." The term "visir" also holds significance in Italian, translating to "vizier." In the historical Arab context, a vizier was a prominent political advisor, carrying connotations of "decision" and "support." This linguistic connection led us to choose "VISIR" as an apt name for a decision support system for navigation. The word "VISIR" has been a registered trademark of CMCC since 2015 (https://www.tmdn.org/tmview/#/tmview).
The VISIR-2 name refers to a Python-coded model, in contrast to VISIR-1 which is a Matlab-coded one. However, both models share the approach of using a graph-search method for computing optimal paths for ships.
